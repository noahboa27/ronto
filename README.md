# ronto

ronto is rewrite of the Kilo editor: https://github.com/antirez/kilo

I chose to rewrite this program after finding this [guide](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).
With the project being less than 1000 lines of code and having a clear goal, I figured it would
be the perfect opportunity to get a good grip on the basics of Rust.
