# ronto

A simple, barebones text editor for the terminal. This project is meant to be
practice for me to learn and build my Rust skills. I choose this as my project because I wanted a
behind the scenes look at how such an editor works. Also because there is nice guide written in C
for such a project (https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/). I have learned much about the 
terminal and the C language during this process and can't wait for what's ahead!
